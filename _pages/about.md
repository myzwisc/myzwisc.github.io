About Me
======
I'm currently a senior data & applied scientist at Microsoft Azure AI, working on research and production of Large Language Models (LLM).

I got my Ph.D. at Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, fortunately advised by [Prof. Xiaojin Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/index.html). My PhD research focused on machine learning, especially adversarial machine learning and sequential decision making such as multi-armed bandit and reinforcement learning. I've published a line of research papers on adversarial attacks against [Adversarial Bandits (ICLR23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12595), [No-regret Game Players (IJCAI22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11763), [Sequential Control System (AAAI21)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08704), [Online Reinforcement Learning (ICML20)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12613), [Batch Reinforcement Learning (NeurIPS19)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05821), [Contextual Bandit (GameSec18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05760), and [Stochastic Bandit (NeurIPS18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12188).

Before joining UW-Madison, I was an undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ&hl=en), where I had some fun in unsupervised machine learning, e.g., dimensionality reduction and clustering in social networks.
