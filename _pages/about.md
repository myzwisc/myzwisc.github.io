About Me
======
I'm currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Prof. Xiaojin Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/index.html). Before joining UW-Madison, I was an undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest lies in machine learning, especially adversarial machine learning and sequential decision making such as multi-armed bandit and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in solving real-world problems related to recommendation systems, search ranking, deep learning, unsupervised learning (e.g., dimensionality reduction and clustering), differential privacy, trust-worthy AI, machine teaching, and optimization.

Very recently, I have been working on adversarial attacks of sequential decision making process. Check out a line of my publications on attacking [Sequential Control System (AAAI21)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08704), [Online Reinforcement Learning (ICML20)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12613), [Batch Reinforcement Learning (NeurIPS19)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05821), [Contextual Bandit (GameSec18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05760), and [Stochastic Bandit (NeurIPS18)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12188).
